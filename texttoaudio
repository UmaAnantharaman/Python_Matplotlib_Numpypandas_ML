mytext = 'Autism, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects communication and behavior. The exact causes of autism are still not fully understood, but research suggests that a combination of genetic and environmental factors contributes to its development.1. Genetic factors: Research shows that there is a strong genetic component to autism. Twin studies suggest that if one identical twin has autism, the other has a 90% chance of also having it. However, the specific genes involved have not yet been identified. A study by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative identified 16 new genetic variants associated with autism, bringing the total known to 106.
